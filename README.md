# A Phenomenological Model for the Photon's Quantum ReferenceFrame

This repository contains the source code and PDF for a theoretical physics paper exploring the concept of a photon's quantum reference frame (QRF).

### **Abstract**
> We propose a phenomenological model for describing physics from a photon-centered quantum reference frame (QRF)[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Our approach combines first-principles constraints with a minimal phenomenological layer to capture complex quantum-optical effects while retaining regulator-independent, gauge-invariant observables[cite: 2]. [cite_start]In contrast to the classical no-go result that no inertial rest frame exists for a photon, we show that a superposition of ultra-relativistic Lorentz boosts, conditioned on the photon's quantum state, can operationally realize a photon's perspective[cite: 3]. [cite_start]We make the construction explicit by (i) specifying the operator map and its domain, (ii) choosing an explicit light-front regularization scheme and proving that our key observables are independent of the regulator, and (iii) bounding massless little-group (E(2)) effects relative to our leading signals[cite: 4]. [cite_start]We then give a concrete Hongâ€“Ouâ€“Mandel (HOM) interferometer design and error budget that could resolve the predicted visibility change at the $3\times 10^{-4}$ level, and reframe an atom-interferometer prediction as a future target with scaling plots[cite: 5]. [cite_start]We position the work within the quantum-reference-frame (QRF) and relativistic quantum information (RQI) literature and conclude with an outlook toward a full group-theoretic massless-QRF formalism[cite: 6].

### **Authorship and Origin: A Human-AI Collaboration** ðŸ¤–

**This paper is an experimental project and was primarily generated by an AI (Google's Gemini) under human direction.**

I created this project out of personal interest to explore the capabilities of large language models in cutting-edge scientific research. My role was to:
* Pose the initial research question.
* Guide the AI's line of reasoning.
* Provide iterative feedback, corrections, and high-level structure.
* Critique the AI's output to refine the arguments and experimental design.

The AI's role was to:
* Perform the bulk of the literature research and writing.
* Formalize the mathematical concepts based on my guidance.
* Draft the experimental details, including the error budget and scaling laws.
* Generate the LaTeX code for the manuscript.

The goal of this repository is to be fully transparent about the process. This is not a formal academic paper submitted for peer review, but rather a public exploration of human-AI collaboration in science.
